# Project: MNIST Dataset with f-GANs

## Description
This project implements **f-GANs** (f-divergence Generative Adversarial Networks) for image generation using the **MNIST dataset**. The goal is to explore and analyze the **precision-recall trade-offs** in generative modeling. The project includes training, evaluation, and visualization of generated images, along with a detailed report and presentation slides.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to generate handwritten digit images using an **f-GAN**. The project involves experimenting with different types of divergences (such as **KL-divergence** and **JS-divergence**) to observe their impact on the quality of generated images and precision-recall trade-offs.

### Key Features:
- Implementation of an **f-GAN** to generate realistic handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Comparison of various **f-divergences** to assess their impact on image quality.
- Includes a detailed project report and presentation slides.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a generator capable of creating realistic handwritten digit images.
- Test and compare multiple divergences to understand how they affect the diversity and fidelity of generated images.
- Provide a comprehensive analysis of the results in the project report and presentation.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (version 3.8+)
- **PyTorch** (for neural network implementation)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Pandas

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository  
Clone this repository to your local directory using the following command:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FChen-Lab/mnist-fgan.git
cd mnist-fgan
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Deactivate the environment when done:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prepare the Data
The MNIST dataset will be automatically downloaded when running the program. Ensure your internet connection is active during execution.

## Repository Structure
Here’s the structure of the files in this repository:
```bash
mnist-fgan/
├── checkpoints/             # Directory for saving trained models
├── README.md                # Project documentation (this file)
├── TrainBIS.py              # Main script for training the f-GAN
├── UtilsBIS.py              # Utility functions for data loading and visualization
├── generate.py              # Script for generating images using the trained model
├── model.py                 # Contains the generator and discriminator models
├── project_report.pdf       # Detailed project report
├── slides_presentation.pdf  # Presentation slides for the project
└── requirements.txt         # List of dependencies
```
## Usage
Training the Model
To train the f-GAN model, run the following command:

```bash
python TrainBIS.py --epochs 50 --lr 0.0002 --batch_size 64 --divergence KLD 
```
Arguments:

--epochs: Number of training epochs.

--lr : The learning rate to use for training.

--batch_size: Batch size for training.

--divergence: Type of f-divergence to use (KLD, RKL, CHI, SQH, JSD, GAN, PR).

### Generating Images
To generate images using the trained model, run:
```bash
python generate.py 
```

## Results
Sample images generated by the f-GAN are saved in the `samples/` directory. Each image is saved as a `.png` file and named with a sequential number. Additionally, a grid of the first 64 images is saved in the `grid/` directory as `generated_images.png`. 

You can inspect these images to evaluate the performance of the generator in producing realistic handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
